# Automated Analysis of Zebrafish Behaviours

Automated analysis of zebrafish behaviours is a image processing framework to autonomously detect zebrafish locations and orientations in videos or images. Zebrafish model systems have been extensively utilized as a surrogate for understanding mammalian brain functions. The goal of this project is to detect zebrafish locations and orientations using deep learning. Using the location and orientation data over the length of the experiment one can extrapolate higher level behavious like resting time, speed, time spent in top of well etc.
